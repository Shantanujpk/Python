➔ + (Addition Operator)
Definition: Adds two numbers.

How it works: Takes the first number and increases it by the second number.

Example: 1 + 1 → Add 1 to 1 → Answer: 2

➔ * (Multiplication Operator)
Definition: Multiplies two numbers.

How it works: Repeats addition. (Example: 2 × 3 means 2 added 3 times → 2 + 2 + 2)

Example: 1 * 1 → Multiply 1 by 1 → Answer: 1

➔ / (Division Operator)
Definition: Divides one number by another and gives the exact answer (can be decimal).

How it works: Splits the first number into parts based on the second number.

Example: 1 / 1 → 1 divided by 1 → Answer: 1.0

➔ // (Floor Division Operator)
Definition: Divides one number by another and keeps only the whole number part.

How it works: Divides normally, then drops anything after the decimal point.

Example: 7 // 2 → 7 divided by 2 is 3.5 → Keep only 3

➔ ** (Exponentiation Operator)
Definition: Raises a number to the power of another number.

How it works: Multiplies the number by itself many times.

Example: 2 ** 4 → 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 → Answer: 16

➔ % (Modulo Operator)
Definition: Gives the remainder after division.

How it works: Divides the first number by the second and returns only what's left.

Example: 7 % 2 → 7 divided by 2 is 3 remainder 1

# Addition: Adds two numbers
print(1 + 1)  # Output: 2

# Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers
print(1 * 1)  # Output: 1

# Division: Divides two numbers and gives a decimal answer
print(1 / 1)  # Output: 1.0

# Floor Division: Divides and keeps only the whole number part (ignores decimal)
print(7 // 2)  # Output: 3

# Exponentiation: 2 raised to the power of 4 (2*2*2*2)
print(2 ** 4)  # Output: 16

# Modulus: Gives the remainder after division
print(7 % 2)  # Output: 1
