"""Introduction to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
In programming, there are two main ways to write code:

âœ… 1) Procedural Programming

Code is written in a sequence of steps (like a list of instructions).

You work with functions and data separately.

Example: writing one big recipe that does everything.

âœ… 2) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

You combine data and functions together into one unit called an object.

You create classes that describe how these objects should behave.

Example: imagine youâ€™re building a robot. Youâ€™ll describe what it can do (functions) and what it has (data).

Key ideas of OOP (in simple words)
ðŸ”¹ Classes: These are templates. Think of it like a blueprint for making an object (like a cookie cutter!).
ðŸ”¹ Objects: These are the actual cookies you create from the cookie cutter (the real things you work with).
ðŸ”¹ Attributes / Properties: Data that the object has (like its color, size, etc.).
ðŸ”¹ Methods: Functions inside the object that describe what it can do.

Why OOP is Useful?
âœ… It makes code easier to understand (like working with real-world things).
âœ… It avoids repeating the same code (because you can make many objects from the same class).
âœ… It helps you organize your code in a clean way.

In short:

Procedural programming = step-by-step instructions.

OOP = building blocks (objects) that you can reuse and organize!"""
