Python Modules and Package Management
This project demonstrates the basic concepts of Python modules, their types, and how to manage external packages using pip.

ðŸ“š About Modules
Modules allow us to use existing code written by others, saving time and effort when developing new programs.

There are two types of modules:
Internal Modules (Built-In):   These are provided by Python itself.
Example: hashlib
No installation is needed.

External Modules:  Code written by external developers, made available for use.
Must be installed separately using pip.
Example: pandas, sklearn, tensorflow

ðŸ”§ Using pip (Package Installer for Python)
pip is the default package manager for Python.

It fetches and installs external libraries from the internet.

Always use pip install <package-name> in the terminal (not inside the Python interpreter).
Example:
bash
pip install pandas
pip install tensorflow
Note:
If you are using VS Code, open the integrated terminal (Ctrl + ~) to run pip install commands.
Do not run them inside the Python shell (>>>) or it will throw an error.

ðŸ—‚ Where Are Installed Packages Stored?
On Windows (default installation location):

C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<version>\Lib\site-packages
On Mac/Linux:
/usr/local/lib/python<version>/site-packages
You can check your installed packages inside these directories.

ðŸ§ª Sample Python Code
python

import pandas       # External module (needs pip install)
import sklearn      # External module (needs pip install)
import hashlib      # Internal (built-in) module
import tensorflow   # External module (needs pip install)

print("Checking the installations")


âœ… Quick Summary
Internal Module/Package    No pip
Extenal Module/ Package    Use pip
