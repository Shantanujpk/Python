"""ðŸ“Œ What is map()?
map() is a built-in Python function that applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.).

Itâ€™s part of Pythonâ€™s functional programming toolkit.

ðŸ“Œ Why do we use it?
To apply the same operation to all items in a collection efficiently and cleanly.

Itâ€™s a more concise and readable alternative to writing a for loop."""

# map functiuon applies a function to each element in the sequence and returns new sequence 
# example squre of each element in a list 
from functools import reduce

def squre (x):
    return x*x

l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
newl =[]

for item in l:
    newl.append(item*item)
print (newl)

# i can do the same thing in one line 
# use map

print (newl2)

"""ðŸ“Œ What is filter()?
filter() is a built-in Python function that lets you filter out elements from an iterable based on a condition (a function that returns True or False).

ðŸ“Œ Why do we use it?
To create a new iterable with only the items that meet certain criteria.

Itâ€™s an efficient way to remove unwanted elements from a list or other collection.

def filter_function(a):
    return a>5

newl4 = list(filter(lambda y : y>5 , l))
print (newl4)


"""ðŸ“Œ What is reduce()?
reduce() is a function from Pythonâ€™s functools module that applies a rolling computation to a sequence of elements, combining them into a single result.

ðŸ“Œ Why do we use it?
To accumulate or reduce a sequence of values into a single result (like sum, product, or custom aggregations).

Itâ€™s especially useful when you want to combine elements with an operation (e.g., adding or multiplying) sequentially.

# reduce
# takes two argument ad returns a single value
