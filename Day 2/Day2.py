#  PIP is used to install modules 
#  Example pip install panda 

#  pip is package manager : whatever you need pip will get it for you from internet or outside
#  pip install pandas will install pandas  (Note: open terminal if you are using VSCode and enter the command in the terminal, If you are in python terminal it will give you an error) 
import pandas
import sklearn # scikit-learn (Ml lab)
import hashlib # this is built in module so we do not need to pip install it.
import tensorflow # while tensorflow is extenal module so we need to pip install it. (this will give error because we havent installed it )
# installed labs usually goes in  C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<version>\Lib\site-packages  location, you can check if needed 

print ("Checking the indtallations")
